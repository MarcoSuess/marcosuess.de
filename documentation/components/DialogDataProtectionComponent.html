  &lt;h3&gt;1. Data protection at a glance&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;General notes&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The following notices provide a simple overview of what happens to your
    personal data when you visit this website. Personal data is any data that
    can be used to identify you personally. For detailed information on the
    subject of data protection, please refer to our privacy policy listed below
    this text.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Data collection on this website&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You
    can find the contact details of the website operator in the section
    &quot;Information about the responsible party&quot; in this data protection
    declaration.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;How do we collect your data?&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    On the one hand, your data is collected by you providing it to us. This can
    be, for example, data that you enter in a contact form.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Other data is collected automatically or after your consent when you visit
    the website by our IT systems. This is mainly technical data (e.g. internet
    browser, operating system or time of page view). The collection of this data
    takes place automatically as soon as you enter this website.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;What do we use your data for?&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Some of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website.
    Other data may be used to analyze your user behavior.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;What rights do you have regarding your data?&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    You have the right at any time to receive information free of charge about
    the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You also
    have a right to request the correction or deletion of this data. If you have
    given your consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any
    time for the future. You also have the right to request the restriction of
    the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances.
    Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent
    supervisory authority.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    You can contact us at any time with regard to this and other questions on
    the subject of data protection.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Third-party analytics and tools&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    When visiting this website, your surfing behavior can be statistically
    evaluated. be evaluated. This is done mainly with so-called analysis
    programs.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    You can find detailed information about these analysis programs in the
    following privacy policy.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;2. General notes and mandatory information&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Data protection&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very
    seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with
    the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal
    data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy
    policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also
    explains how and for what purpose this is done.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We point out that data transmission over the Internet (eg communication by
    e-mail) security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by
    third parties is not possible.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Note on the responsible body&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The responsible party for data processing on this website is:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Marco S&amp;uuml;ss&lt;br /&gt;
    Vogesenstra&amp;szlig;e 22&lt;br /&gt;
    78549 Spaichingen
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Telefon: 017641004206&lt;br /&gt;
    E-Mail: suess_1998@web.de
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with
    others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data
    (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Storage duration&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy
    policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data
    processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for
    deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be
    deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your
    personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the
    latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other
    third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these
    tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third
    countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of
    data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these
    countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data
    to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take
    legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US
    authorities (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently
    store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no
    influence on these processing activities.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Revocation of your consent to data processing&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.
    You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of
    the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by
    the revocation.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;
    Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing
    (Art. 21 DSGVO)
  &lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E
    OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL
    DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS
    ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL
    BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF
    YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN
    DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE
    YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE PURPOSE OF
    ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21
    (1) DSGVO).
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU
    HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
    CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
    PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS CONNECTED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU
    OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE
    PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) DSGVO).
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of
    appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of
    their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged
    breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or
    judicial remedies.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Right to data portability&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis
    of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a
    third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct
    transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar
    as it is technically feasible.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Information, deletion and correction&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right
    at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin
    and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right
    to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for
    further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any
    time.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Right to restriction of processing&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
    personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right
    to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually
      need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the
      right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully,
      you may request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise,
      defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request restriction
      of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing
      of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet
      been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
      restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may -
    apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the
    assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the
    rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important
    public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;3. Data collection on this website&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Contact form&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your data from the inquiry
    form including the contact data you provided there will be stored by us for
    the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We
    do not pass on this data without your consent.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, if your
    request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the
    implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
    processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing
    of requests addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your consent
    (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if this was requested.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request
    us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing
    the data no longer applies (e.g. after we have completed processing your
    request). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods -
    remain unaffected.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Request by e-mail, phone or fax&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    When you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your inquiry including all
    personal data resulting from it (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed
    by us for the purpose of handling your processed. We will not pass on this
    data without your consent.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, if your
    request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the
    implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
    processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing
    of requests addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your consent
    (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if this was requested.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you
    request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for
    storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been
    processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular legal retention
    periods - remain unaffected.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;4. Plugins and tools&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Google Web Fonts&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    This page uses so-called web fonts provided by Google for the uniform
    display of fonts. When you call up a page, your browser loads the required
    web fonts into its browser cache in order to display texts and fonts
    correctly.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    For this purpose, the browser you use must connect to Google&#x27;s servers.
    Through this, Google obtains knowledge that this website was accessed via
    your IP address. The use of Google WebFonts is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
    f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the uniform
    presentation of the typeface on his website. If a corresponding consent has
    been requested (e.g. consent to store cookies), the processing is based
    exclusively on Art. 6 (1) lit. a DSGVO; the consent can be revoked at any
    time.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    If your browser does not support web fonts, a default font is used by your
    computer.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;

Data protection at a glance</h3>  <h4>General notes</h4>  <p>    The following notices provide a simple overview of what happens to your    personal data when you visit this website. Personal data is any data that    can be used to identify you personally. For detailed information on the    subject of data protection, please refer to our privacy policy listed below    this text.  </p>  <h4>Data collection on this website</h4>  <h4>Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?</h4>  <p>    Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You    can find the contact details of the website operator in the section    "Information about the responsible party" in this data protection    declaration.  </p>  <h4>How do we collect your data?</h4>  <p>    On the one hand, your data is collected by you providing it to us. This can    be, for example, data that you enter in a contact form.  </p>  <p>    Other data is collected automatically or after your consent when you visit    the website by our IT systems. This is mainly technical data (e.g. internet    browser, operating system or time of page view). The collection of this data    takes place automatically as soon as you enter this website.  </p>  <h4>What do we use your data for?</h4>  <p>    Some of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website.    Other data may be used to analyze your user behavior.  </p>  <h4>What rights do you have regarding your data?</h4>  <p>    You have the right at any time to receive information free of charge about    the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You also    have a right to request the correction or deletion of this data. If you have    given your consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any    time for the future. You also have the right to request the restriction of    the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances.    Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent    supervisory authority.  </p>  <p>    You can contact us at any time with regard to this and other questions on    the subject of data protection.  </p>  <h4>Third-party analytics and tools</h4>  <p>    When visiting this website, your surfing behavior can be statistically    evaluated. be evaluated. This is done mainly with so-called analysis    programs.  </p>  <p>    You can find detailed information about these analysis programs in the    following privacy policy.  </p>  <h3>2. General notes and mandatory information</h3>  <h4>Data protection</h4>  <p>    The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very    seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with    the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.  </p>  <p>    When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal    data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy    policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also    explains how and for what purpose this is done.  </p>  <p>    We point out that data transmission over the Internet (eg communication by    e-mail) security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by    third parties is not possible.  </p>  <h4>Note on the responsible body</h4>  <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>  <p>    Marco S&uuml;ss<br />    Vogesenstra&szlig;e 22<br />    78549 Spaichingen  </p>  <p>    Telefon: 017641004206<br />    E-Mail: suess_1998@web.de  </p>  <p>    The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with    others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data    (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).  </p>  <h4>Storage duration</h4>  <p>    Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy    policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data    processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for    deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be    deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your    personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the    latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.  </p>  <h4>Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries</h4>  <p>    Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other    third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these    tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third    countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of    data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these    countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data    to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take    legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US    authorities (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently    store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no    influence on these processing activities.  </p>  <h4>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h4>  <p>    Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.    You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of    the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by    the revocation.  </p>  <h4>    Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing    (Art. 21 DSGVO)  </h4>  <p>    IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E    OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL    DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS    ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL    BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF    YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN    DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE    YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE PURPOSE OF    ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21    (1) DSGVO).  </p>  <p>    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU    HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA    CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO    PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS CONNECTED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU    OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE    PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) DSGVO).  </p>  <h4>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</h4>  <p>    In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of    appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of    their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged    breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or    judicial remedies.  </p>  <h4>Right to data portability</h4>  <p>    You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis    of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a    third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct    transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar    as it is technically feasible.  </p>  <h4>Information, deletion and correction</h4>  <p>    Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right    at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin    and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right    to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for    further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any    time.  </p>  <h4>Right to restriction of processing</h4>  <p>    You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your    personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right    to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:  </p>  <ul>    <li>      If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually      need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the      right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.    </li>    <li>      If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully,      you may request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.    </li>    <li>      If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise,      defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request restriction      of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.    </li>    <li>      If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing      of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet      been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the      restriction of the processing of your personal data.    </li>  </ul>  <p>    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may -    apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the    assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the    rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important    public interest of the European Union or a Member State.  </p>  <h3>3. Data collection on this website</h3>  <h4>Contact form</h4>  <p>    If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your data from the inquiry    form including the contact data you provided there will be stored by us for    the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We    do not pass on this data without your consent.  </p>  <p>    The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, if your    request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the    implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the    processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing    of requests addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your consent    (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if this was requested.  </p>  <p>    The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request    us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing    the data no longer applies (e.g. after we have completed processing your    request). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular retention periods -    remain unaffected.  </p>  <h4>Request by e-mail, phone or fax</h4>  <p>    When you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your inquiry including all    personal data resulting from it (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed    by us for the purpose of handling your processed. We will not pass on this    data without your consent.  </p>  <p>    The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, if your    request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the    implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the    processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing    of requests addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your consent    (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if this was requested.  </p>  <p>    The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you    request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for    storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been    processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular legal retention    periods - remain unaffected.  </p>  <h3>4.
