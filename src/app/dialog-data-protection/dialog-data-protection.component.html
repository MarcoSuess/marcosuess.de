  <h3>2. General notes and mandatory information</h3>
  <h4>Data protection</h4>
  <p>
    The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very
    seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with
    the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal
    data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy
    policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also
    explains how and for what purpose this is done.
  </p>
  <p>
    We point out that data transmission over the Internet (eg communication by
    e-mail) security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by
    third parties is not possible.
  </p>
  <h4>Note on the responsible body</h4>
  <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
  <p>
    Marco S&uuml;ss<br />
    Vogesenstra&szlig;e 22<br />
    78549 Spaichingen
  </p>

  <p>
    Telefon: 017641004206<br />
    E-Mail: suess_1998@web.de
  </p>
  <p>
    The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with
    others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data
    (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
  </p>

  <h4>Storage duration</h4>
  <p>
    Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy
    policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data
    processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for
    deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be
    deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your
    personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the
    latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.
  </p>
  <h4>Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries</h4>
  <p>
    Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other
    third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these
    tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third
    countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of
    data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these
    countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data
    to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take
    legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US
    authorities (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently
    store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no
    influence on these processing activities.
  </p>
  <h4>Revocation of your consent to data processing</h4>
  <p>
    Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.
    You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of
    the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by
    the revocation.
  </p>

    OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL
    DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS
    ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL
    BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF
    YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN
    DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE
    YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE PURPOSE OF
    ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 21
    (1) DSGVO).
  </p>
  <p>
    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU
    HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
    CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
    PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS CONNECTED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU
    OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE
    PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 21 (2) DSGVO).

  <p>
    In the event of breaches of the GDPR, data subjects shall have a right of
    appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of
    their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged
    breach. The right of appeal is without prejudice to other administrative or
    judicial remedies.
  </p>
  <h4>Right to data portability</h4>
  <p>
    You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis
    of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a
    third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct
    transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar
    as it is technically feasible.
  </p>
  <h4>Information, deletion and correction</h4>
  <p>
    Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right
    at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin
    and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right
    to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for
    further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any
    time.
  </p>
  <h4>Right to restriction of processing</h4>
  <p>
    You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
    personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right
    to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually
      need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the
      right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully,
      you may request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.

      defend or enforce legal claims, you have the right to request restriction
      of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing
      of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet
      been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
      restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may -
    apart from being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the
    assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the
    rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important
    public interest of the European Union or a Member State.
  </p>

    The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, if your

    implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
