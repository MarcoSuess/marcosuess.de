      <h2>About me.</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Marco,  22 years old Jr. Front-End Developer living in
        Spaichingen. In January 2021 I decided to enhance my professional field.
        <br />

        Since my childhood I was passionate about IT. When I discovered the
        "Developer-Akademie.de", a new chapter in my life has started.
        <br />
        In July 2017, I successfully completed my apprenticeship as a Specialist
        for metal technology. Up to now I am still working in this industry,
        where I gathered professional experience and skills in various small and
        large companies.
